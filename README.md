# ðŸŒ€ Multi-Level Maze Generator Game (Raylib Edition)

A **multi-level maze generation and exploration game** written in **C** and powered by **[raylib](https://www.raylib.com/)** for rendering.  
It uses **Depth-First Search (DFS)** to procedurally generate unique mazes, places features like stairs, and lets you navigate from a **start (S)** to an **exit (E)** across multiple levels.
